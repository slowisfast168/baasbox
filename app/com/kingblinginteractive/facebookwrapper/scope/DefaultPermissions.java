  /**
   * Provides access to a subset of items that are part of a person's public profile.
   * 
   * A person's public profile refers to the following properties on the user object by default:
   * <ul>
   * <li>id</li>
   * <li>name</li>
   * <li>first_name</li>
   * <li>last_name</li>
   * <li>link</li>
   * <li>gender</li>
   * <li>locale</li>
   * <li>timezone</li>
   * <li>updated_time</li>
   * <li>verified</li>
   * </ul>
   * 
   * On the web, public_profile is implied with every request and isn't required, although the best practice is to
   * declare it. On iOS and Android, you must manually request it as part of your login flow.<br />
   * <br />
   * 
   * gender & locale can only be accessed if:
   * 
   * <ul>
   * <li>The person queried is the person using the app.</li>
   * <li>The person queried is using the app, and is a friend of the person using the app.</li>
   * <li>The person queried is using the app, is not a friend of the person using the app, but the app includes either
   * an app access token or an appsecret_proof argument with the call.</li>
   * <br />
   * <strong>Review</strong> Your app may use this permission without review from Facebook.
